## Challenge Summary
There are a couple ways this script can be modified to be used for other elections. 
We could look for specific demographics for each of the candidates, like age, ethnicity or even gender. The candidates can use those demographics to get a better understanding of what groups of people to appeal more to.
Another way to modify this script is to change counties to states and this would analyze for a congressional election.
